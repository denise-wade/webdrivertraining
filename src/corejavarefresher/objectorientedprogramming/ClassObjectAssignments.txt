Create a Circle class 
radius as double 
color as String
Two constructors one accepts radius, color
as parameter and one is blank(no parameter)
methods
- getting and setting the radius
- calculate the area (radius*radius*Math.PI)
- getting and setting the color

Create another class having main method. Inside that class,
Create four objects of Circle and provide different radius 
and color.Print radius, color and area of all 
the four circles on console.









Create a cylinder class inherit from circle
having height as additional attribute
two constructors, one with three parameters, radius,color and height and 
other without any parameter
the following behaviours/methods
=set and get height
- Override the getArea() method in Circle to implement area of the Cylinder
- get volume which internally calls getarea method of circle (height * area)

- create another class having main method. Create 
3 objects of cyclinder having different values of color, radius and height
